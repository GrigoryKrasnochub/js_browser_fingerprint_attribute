# js_browser_fingerprint_attributes

Hi-hi!
There is implementation of some algorithms for obtaining information from a browser about a computer, network and browser itself.

This scripts were written for dreamhack 3 competition in about 24 hours, so this lost some of code best practice. (<a href="https://github.com/pymq/demhack3">check my demhack3 project</a>)



## About attributes:
Below some information about the source of idea/code/both, that I used and adapted for my purpose, and some attributes description:

### fingerprintjs

I just use <a href="https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs">fingerprintjs lib</a>, for obtain base browser attributes. It's work, it's fine.
It provides a lot of attributes, unfortunately some of them works only in some browsers, chrome for example.
